                <h4>Day 1</h4>
                <p>Arrival to Uganda through the Entebbe International Airport <br>
                    You will be met by our tour guide and driven to your first accommodation for the first night in
                    Uganda</p>
                <h4>Day 2</h4>
                <p>Transfer from Entebbe to jinja <br>
                    This drive lasts for approximately 2 hours and leads to the first industrial town of Uganda (jinja)
                    <br>
                    While here you shall have an evening cruise on the Nile leading to the exact source of the Nile
                    spot.
                    It’s quite experiential seeing where all these huge sums of water spill off from the Lake Victoria
                    to
                    begin a journey up north crossing countries like South Sudan, Sudan, Egypt till it empties into the
                    Mediterranean Sea. <br>
                    Jinja also provides relaxation spots where you can shade the flight fatigue off from before we dive
                    into what’s going to be a rather very engaging safari. <br>
                    Our choice lodge is The Haven Lodge
                </p>
                <h4>Day 3</h4>
                <p>Transfer to Kapchorwa region <br>
                    The Kapchorwa highlands are home to the famous Elgon mountains that have the oldest Caldera in
                    the East African region. This is also the mother of the famous three Sipi falls. This region is
                    known for
                    great coffee tours and community trekking ventures that lead you across all the three falls not
                    leaving behind the amazing sunsets and sunrises. <br>
                    Our choice lodge here is Rafiki lodge </p>
                <h4>Day 4</h4>
                <p>Transfer to Moroto <br>
                    Leaving Kapchorwa region as early as 9am to embark on yet a still dirt road but quite revealing,
                    takes
                    you approximately 4 hours before you get to Moroto town. <br>
                    Your accommodation on this day will be at Karatunga lodge and in the evening, you will be guided to
                    a community walk to the Karamajong homes also known as Amanyattas. The Karamajong people are
                    some of the still intact indigenous cultures of the land and you will be ushered in with a cultural
                    guide from the community. <br>
                    These people are mainly pastoralists whose lives rotate around cows, goats and sheep. Their history
                    is one that has been of guns and life losses as they had cattle rustling conflicts with their
                    cousins
                    from the neighboring borders of Kenya, the Masai and Kalenjin. It should be noted that the
                    government has conducted a successful transformation of these people’s lifestyle from hostile to
                    rather a calm and amicable social living by withdrawing all guns that were previously in their
                    possession, therefore its safe to visit the communities.</p>
                <h4>Day 5</h4>
                <p>Transfer to Kidepo Valley National Park <br>
                    From Moroto you will again embark on a dirt road that leads you through the plains and hills of
                    Kotido and Kabong districts bringing you to one of the most beautiful and scenic parks of Uganda.
                    <br>
                    Kidepo Valley National Park is known for its outstanding landscapes, and rocks that work as
                    preferred resting grounds for the large cats of the land. Its here that you experience the biggest
                    herds of buffalos and elephants on a safari. The park is bordered by South Sudan on the North and
                    Kenya to the East giving animals a wide migration corridor. <br>
                    On this evening you will have an evening drive in the park and later retire to your lodge. <br>
                    Our choice lodge for this destination is Kidepo Savannah Lodge. </p>
                <h4>Day 6</h4>
                <p>A full day drive in Kidepo valley national park. <br>
                    Remember this is a vast national park and its only worth it that you give an entire day of drive to
                    explore the hidden treasures of the land. <br>
                    Night will be at Kidepo Savannah Lodge</p>
                <h4>Day 7</h4>
                <p>Transfer to Murchison Falls National Park <br>
                    The drive to Murchison will take approximately 5hrs, so leaving savannah lodge at 8am will mean
                    that you will have a short break in Gulu city for lunch before you proceed for roughly 2hrs and
                    30mins to the main gate of Murchison Falls National Park. <br>
                    After checking in you will drive to the top of falls for a refreshing experience of the magnificent
                    falls,
                    a huge sum of water that plunges through a 7-8meter gorge and later creates a foam beneath the
                    falls coming from the organic composition in the water. <br>
                    You shall later drive heading to the lodge for the evening and the night at large. <br>
                    Choice lodge is Pakuba Safari lodge</p>
                <h4>Day 8</h4>
                <p>This morning you shall wake up early at 5am prepare to have breakfast and later leave the lodge at
                    6:30am for a morning gamedrive. Its crucial that you appreciate the behavior of these wild animals
                    and play along if you are to stand higher chances of great sightings especially for the cats. Note that
                    most of these cats are active in the night and as the sun rises, they opt for shelter in thickets making
                    it hard to be sighted during day. The morning drive lasts for approximately 4hrs and later you will
                    head back to your lodge for lunch. <br>
                    You will be expected to be at the boat jetty by 1:50pm ready for the boat cruise at 2pm. This cruise is
                    approximately 3hrs and brings you close to hippos, crocodiles, elephants when they come to the
                    river for a sip and bath, giraffes and a variety of bird species. <br>
                    Accommodation is still Pakuba safari lodge</p>
                <h4>Day 9</h4>
                <p>Transfer to Kibale National Park <br>
                    Kibale National Park also unknown as the primate capital of the world with 13 different species of
                    primates is the ideal destination for chimpanzee tracking. This is located approximately 5hrs hours
                    drive south of Murchison falls national park and you will be making a lunch break in fort portal town
                    before proceeding to the lodge in Kibale. <br>

                    you leave the lodge early enough to get to the briefing point in time. Its roughly 40mins from the
                    lodge to the briefing point. Its at this point that clients are divided in smaller groups and allocated
                    ranger guides that will lead them through the activity. <br>
