                <p>This park lies at the northern end of the Albertine rift valley, where the sweeping Bunyoro
                    escarpment tumbles into vast palm-dotted savannah. First gazette as a game reserve in 1962, it is
                    Uganda’s largest and oldest conservation area, hosting over 70 species of mammals and 451 birds.
                    <br> The
                    park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 45m over the remnant rift valley wall, creating
                    the dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of
                    rapids. The mighty cascade drains the last of the river’s energy, transforming it into a broad,
                    placid stream that flows quietly across the rift valley floor into the Albert. At Murchison Falls,
                    the Nile squeezes through an 8m wide gorge and plunges with a thunderous roar into the Devil’s
                    Cauldron, creating a trademark rainbow.
                    <br> This stretch of river provides one of Uganda’s most
                    remarkable wildlife spectacles. Regular visitors to the riverbanks include elephants, giraffes,
                    buffaloes; while hippos, Nile crocodiles, and aquatic birds are permanent residents.

                <p>A wilderness park, dry hot and isolated, yet spectacular, magnificent and virgin, waiting to e
                    discovered. Traversed by large sand rivers, the park is renowned for its distinctive composition of
                    wild game co-existing with the dry mountain, forest, open savannah and hilltops capped by rock
                    kopjes. Enjoy the isolated wilderness dominated by the 2,750m mount Morungole and transected by the
                    Kidepo and great Narus rivers.
                    <br> Perennial rains may make Kidepo an oasis in the semi desert, but its tract of rugged savannah
                    is home to 77 mammal species and almost 500 birds. Game viewing is exciting all year round and so is
                    bird watching, foot safaris and mountain climbing. And even in dry season. It is worth the drive
                    just to visit the seasonal Kidepo river and stroll along its 50m wide bed of sand between banks
                    covered with Borassus palm trees.
                    <br>The 1442km is located in the Karamoja region of northern Uganda and borders the South Sudan in
                    the north west and Kenya in the north east.

                    <br> Set against the backdrop of the jagged Rwenzori mountains, the park’s magnificent vistas

                    cultural history. There are many opportunities for visitors to meet the local communities and enjoy

                    renamed two years later to commemorate a visit by Queen Elizabeth II.

                <p>As early as 150 AD alexandrine photographer, Ptolemy wrote of snowcapped mountain range deep in the
                    heart of Africa, which he clamed was the source of the world’s longest river, the Nile. He called it
                    “mountains of the moon.”
                    <br> Indeed, over the centuries, mountaineers who later explored Ptolemy’s mountains found the high
                    Rwenzori glaciers and snow peaks whose melt waters certainly represent the highest springs off the
                    Nile, the alpine highland of glaciers snow fields, hot spring and blue cirque lakes makes Rwenzori
                    one of Africa’s most beautiful mountain parks. Reaching an elevation of 5109m, Rwenzori is Africa’s
                    tallest mountain range exceeded in altitude by mt Kilimanjaro and my Kenya, carrying Africa’s third,
                    fourth and fifth highest peaks that are visible for miles around. Some of its peaks incomparable,
                    beautiful and mist-shrouded carry permanent snow and glaciers, while the lower slopes are covered
                    with dense forest.
                    <br>The mountain’s slopes above 1600m are the preserves of hikers who are rate the Rwenzori to be
                    the most challenging of all African mountains. A variety of large mammals inhibit the lower slopes
                    but the Rwenzori’s are notable more for their majestic scenery and varied vegetation. Its five
                    distinct vegetation zones montane forest, bamboo forest, tree heath-bog, hagenia-rapanea scrub and
                    afro-alpine moorland provide a unique backdrop to one of the most magnificent national parks in the
                    world. Several endangered species and veery unusual cloud forest flora like giant heathers,
                    groundsels and lobelias, characterize the ranges as ‘Africa’s botanical big game.

                    altitude of between 2227m and 4127m. It was formed to protect the rare mountain gorillas that
                    inhabit its dense forests, and it is also an important habitat for the endangered golden monkeys.
                    Its most striking features are its three conical, extinct volcanoes, part of the spectacular Virunga
                    range that lies along the border region of Uganda, Congo and Rwanda. Mgahinga forms part of the much
                    larger Virunga conservation area which includes adjacent parks in these countries.
                    <br> The park offers a sooth aura of majesty with cool temperatures owing to the mountainous nature

                    <br>The park derives its name from Gahinga a Kinyarwanda word for a pile of volcanic lava stone
                    heaps around which cultivation is carried out. On the other hand, Muhavura means guide and Sabinyo
                    means the old man’s teeth. It bordered to the south by Rwanda and to the West by Congo.
                    <br>While Sabinyo is deeply eroded with jagged crown and deep gorges and ravines, Gahinga has a
                    swamp filled- crater about 180m wide and Muhavura has a small crater lake about 36m wide at its
                    summit. While at the top of Sabinyo, you get to be set foot in all three countries of Uganda, DRC,
                    and Rwanda at the same time. Its views of the volcanoes and gorges with the cool breeze of freshness
                    is unrivaled. On some of the steep mountain slopes are caves formed by lava tubes, one of them being
                    the famous Garama cave located near Ntebeko, the park Headquarters.

                    <br>Though just 371sqkm in size, lake Mburo has a varied landscape full of interest and color. The
                    park is refreshing and full of life given its strategic location near the Kampala – Mbarara highway.

                <p>Semuliki National Park sprawls across the floor of the Semiliki valley on the remote, western side of
                    the Rwenzori. The park is dominated buy the eastern most extension of the great Ituri forest of the
                    Congo basin. This is one of Africa’s most ancient and bio-diversity forests; one of the few to
                    survive the last ice age, 12-18000 years ago.
                    <br> The Semiliki valley contains numerous features associated with central rather than eastern
                    African. Thatched huts are shaded by west African palms, the Semiliki river (which forms the
                    international boundary) is a miniature version of the Congo River, the forest is home to numerous
                    central African wildlife species, and the local population includes a Batwa community that
                    originated from Ituri forest. As a result, this park provides a taste of central Africa without
                    having to leave Uganda.
                    <br>While Semuliki species have been accumulating for over 25000 years, the park contains evidence
                    of even older processes. Hot springs bubble up from the depths to demonstrate the powerful
                    subterranean forces that have been shaping the rift valley during last 14million years.
                    Semuliki forest reserve was created in 1932 and upgraded to a national park status in 1993.
